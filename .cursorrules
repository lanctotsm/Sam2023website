Project rules and steering for Cursor

Windows Command Guidelines (always apply)
- Use PowerShell or CMD commands only.
- Do not use Unix/Linux commands like `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, `find`, etc.
- Use Windows equivalents:
  - `dir` instead of `ls`
  - `type` instead of `cat`
  - `findstr` instead of `grep`
  - Prefer PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Content`, etc.
- Use Windows path separators (`\`) when needed and be mindful of Windows filesystem constraints.
- Development environment assumptions:
  - Operating System: Windows
  - Platform: win32
  - Shell: cmd/PowerShell

Architecture and Requirements References
- Backend specs and plan live under `.kiro/specs/authenticated-album-management/`:
  - Design: `.kiro/specs/authenticated-album-management/design.md`
  - Requirements: `.kiro/specs/authenticated-album-management/requirements.md`
  - Implementation tasks/progress: `.kiro/specs/authenticated-album-management/tasks.md`
- Frontend requirements live under:
  - `.kiro/specs/nextjs-frontend-album-auth/requirements.md`

How to use these references
- When adding or modifying backend endpoints, data models, or auth/session behavior, align with the documents under `.kiro/specs/authenticated-album-management/`.
- When working on frontend auth, albums grid, upload UI, or adaptive layouts, follow `.kiro/specs/nextjs-frontend-album-auth/requirements.md`.
- Prefer small, incremental edits and keep behavior consistent with the acceptance criteria in the referenced requirements.

General guidance
- Prioritize clarity and maintainability; match existing code style.
- Prefer multi-line readability over dense one-liners.
- Avoid introducing deep nesting; use early returns where appropriate.
